is_email(string)
Check if a string is an email.

By design, the implementation of this checking does not follow the specification for a valid email address, but instead it's based on real world cases in order to match more than 99% of emails and catch user mistakes.

:param string: String to check.
:type string: str
:return: True if email, false otherwise.
:rtype: bool
