escape(String string)
Returns an {@link Escaper} instance that escapes special characters in a string so it can
safely be included in XML document as element content. See section <a
href="http:www.w3.orgTR2008REC-xml-20081126#AVNormalize">3.3.3<a> of the XML
specification.

<p>This escaper substitutes {@code 0xFFFD} for non-whitespace control characters and the
character values {@code 0xFFFE} and {@code 0xFFFF} which are not permitted in XML. For more
detail see section <a href="http:www.w3.orgTR2008REC-xml-20081126#charsets">2.2<a> of
the XML specification.

<p>This escaper does not escape non-ASCII characters to their numeric character references
(NCR). Any non-ASCII characters appearing in the input will be preserved in the output.
 Specifically "\r" (carriage return) is preserved in the output, which may result in it being silently converted to "\n" when the XML is parsed.
<p>This escaper does not treat surrogate pairs specially and does not perform Unicode
validation on its input.
